	<h1>Tips for Reading Books for Beginners</h1>
	<ol className='text' >
		<li>Start with a book that interests you: Choose a book that aligns with your interests or hobbies. This will make it easier for you to get into reading and stay engaged.</li>
		<li>Set a realistic reading goal: Start with a manageable reading goal, such as reading for 10-15 minutes a day. Gradually increase your reading time as you become more comfortable.</li>
		<li>Create a reading routine: Set aside a specific time and place for reading each day. This can help you establish a habit and make reading a regular part of your routine.</li>
		<li>Take notes: Write down key points or interesting passages as you read. This can help you remember important details and engage more deeply with the material.</li>
		<li>Don't be afraid to ask for help: If you come across a word or concept you don't understand, don't hesitate to look it up or ask someone for clarification.</li>
		<li>Try different genres: Experiment with different genres to find what you like best. This can help you discover new authors and expand your reading horizons.</li>
		<li>Join a book club: Joining a book club can provide motivation and support, as well as opportunities for discussion and socialization.</li>
		<li>Take breaks: Don't feel like you have to read for hours on end. Take breaks when you need them, and allow yourself time to digest and reflect on what you've read.</li>
		<li>Enjoy the journey: Reading should be a pleasurable experience, so don't put too much pressure on yourself to finish a book quickly or understand everything perfectly. Enjoy the journey and let yourself get lost in the story.</li>
